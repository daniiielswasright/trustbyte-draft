### üì± Android App Anatomy

**Advertisement ID** ‚Äì User-resettable ID used for ad tracking. 

**Android Manifest** ‚Äî The app‚Äôs blueprint. Declares components, permissions, features, and behavior.

**APK (Android Package)** ‚Äî The installable app file that contains code, resources, and a manifest.

**Components** ‚Äî The building blocks of an app: Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers.

**Intents** ‚Äî Signals that apps send to the system or other apps to trigger actions (e.g. opening a file, starting a service, or launching a screen).

**Metadata** ‚Äî Extra information embedded in an app or manifest, such as version number, SDK target, or analytics tags. Used for configuration, tracking, or system behavior.

**Package Installer** ‚Äî The system tool that installs, updates, and removes APKs.

**Permissions** ‚Äî Rules that define what an app is allowed to access (e.g. camera, SIM info, storage).

> **Custom Permissions** ‚Äî App-defined permissions that grant access to internal features or data.

> **Dangerous Permission** ‚Äì Grants access to sensitive data or controls (e.g. camera, contacts, location). Requires explicit user approval at runtime.

> **Normal Permission** ‚Äì Grants access to low-risk features (e.g. internet, vibration). Automatically approved at install time.

> **Signature Permissions** ‚Äî Permissions that can only be granted to apps signed with the same certificate as the OS or another trusted app.  (e.g. Gboard has a android.permission.BIND_INPUT_METHOD which allows Gboard to act as the virtual keyboard preloaded as its signed with same key as the OS).

> **System Permissions** ‚Äî High-level permissions reserved for system apps or firmware (e.g. modify system settings).

**Providers (Content Providers)** ‚Äî Components that manage structured data and allow sharing between apps.

### üî§ Character Encoding & Visual Spoofing

**ASCII** ‚Äî Character set with 128 symbols for English letters, digits, punctuation, and control codes (e.g. A, 7, !, /)

**Byte types** - Categories of bytes based on their role or interpretation in data.

> **Single Byte** ‚Üí 1 byte, represents ASCII chars (e.g., 0x41 ‚Üí 'A'), 

> **Leading Byte** ‚Üí first byte in a multi-byte encoding (e.g., 0xC3 in '√©' UTF-8 0xC3 0xA9)

> **Continuation Byte** ‚Üí follow-up bytes in a multi-byte sequence (e.g., 0xA9 in '√©')

> **Control Byte** ‚Üí bytes representing control signals, not printable characters (e.g., 0x00 NUL, 0x0A LF)

**Code Point** ‚Äî A Unicode-assigned number for each character, starting from U+0000 (e.g. U+0042 = B, U+00A9 = ¬©).

**Confusables** ‚Äî Characters from different scripts that look nearly identical (e.g. Latin b = U+0062, Cyrillic –¨ = U+042C)

**Cyrillic Script** ‚Äî Used in Russian and other Eastern European languages.  Characters resemble Latin.

**Glyphs** ‚Äî Visual shape of a character, which may differ across fonts or styles.  

**Latin Script** ‚Äî Writing system used in English and most Western languages. 

**Lookalikes** ‚Äî Characters that appear similar but are encoded differently (e.g. B vs Œí, I vs I).

**Punycode** ‚Äì An encoding that converts Unicode domain names containing non-ASCII characters into a format usable by the DNS system, which only supports ASCII. This enables internationalized domain names (IDNs) to resolve correctly and show the encoded version. (e.g. a spoofed domain like ‚Äú…°ithub.com‚Äù, with a small letter '…°') becomes `xn--ithub-vkc.com`, which visually mimics but does not resolve to github.com.

**Unicode** ‚Äî Universal encoding system for 149,000 characters across all languages (e.g. U+0062 = B, U+3B2 = Œ≤).

**UTF-8 (Dec)** ‚Äî Decimal values of UTF-8 encoded bytes (e.g. B = 66, ¬© = 194 196).

**UTF-8 (Hex)** ‚Äî Hexadecimal values of UTF-8 encoded bytes.  (e.g. B = 0x42, ¬© = 0xC2 0xA9).

**--vkc** ‚Äì Encoded suffix generated by the Punycode algorithm to represent specific Unicode characters from the original domain (e.g., '…°' in ‚Äú…°ithub.com‚Äù).

**xn--** ‚Äì Prefix indicating a domain name has been Punycode-encoded to support non-ASCII Unicode characters in DNS (e.g. **xn**---ithub-**vkc**).

## üåê Networking Concepts

**IP Address** ‚Äî A number that identifies a device on a network and tells other devices where to send data. There are public IPs and private IPs.  

**Public IP** (72.21.184.64) are assigned by your Internet Provider and used to communicate with devices outside your local network while **Private IP** (192.168.1.0) are assigned by your router for use internally. 

**DNS (Domain Name System)** ‚Äì The naming system that translates human-readable domain names (like github.com) into IP addresses (like 140.82.112.0) so devices can locate and communicate with each other across the internet.

**DNS Resolver** - The specific server or service that all  domain lookups on your device get routed through (e.g. 1.1.1.1 for Cloudflare).

**Open System Interconnection** (OSI) ‚Äî Framework that breaks down how data moves across a network (router, modem) into 7 distinct layers. Those layers are:

> **Layer 1 (Physical)** ‚Äî The literal hardware layer of your network box.

> **Layer 2 (Data Link)** ‚Äî Moves data between devices on the same local network using MAC addresses.

    **Layer 2 Bleeding** ‚Äî An issue where data meant for one local segment (like your home Wi-Fi) leaks into another (like a neighbor‚Äôs), often due to bad setup or spoofed device IDs.

> **Layer 3 (Network)** ‚Äî Decides where data should go across different networks using IP addresses.

> **Layer 4 (Transport)** ‚Äî Makes sure data gets delivered properly, using ports.

> **Layer 5 (Session)** ‚Äî Starts and manages conversations between devices, keeping track of who‚Äôs talking to whom.

> **Layer 6 (Presentation)** ‚Äî Prepares data so both sides understand it‚Äîlike translating, encrypting, or compressing files.

> **Layer 7 (Application)** ‚Äî The layer users interact with directly. Services like websites, email, and messaging live here.

    **Cross-Layer Bleeding** ‚Äì Unintended exposure or leakage of data, control across OSI layers 3 to 7. Often caused by misconfigured routing, NAT overlap, DPI failure, or protocol tunneling. 

**MAC Address** ‚Äî A unique hardware ID for a device‚Äôs network adapter, used to identify devices on a local network.  

**Modem** ‚Äî A device that connects your home or office to the internet by translating signals from your provider into usable data.

**Ports** ‚Äî Logical endpoints used to send and receive data between devices and applications.

**Protocol** ‚Äî A set of agreed rules that devices follow to exchange data properly.

**Router** ‚Äî A device that shares your internet connection with multiple devices and directs traffic to the right destination.
