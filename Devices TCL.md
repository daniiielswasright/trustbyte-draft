Model: T434D 
Kernel: Moly.lr12A.r3.mp.v294.p3
Kernel version: 5.10.209
Suspicious Update Analysis:


**Original phone update version:** v7.06XBA
May 20,2025 forced update version: 6XBG (downgrade)

May 25, 2025 Update version: TCL UI 6XBL (phone says it's currently on TLC UI version v7.06XBL with a build of 6XBL)

  
**Red Flags**:
Version number irregularity (going from 7.06 to 6)
Minor letter change (BA to BG) triggering full system update
Unusual update size (145.9 MB) which is too large for minor patch, too small for legitimate firmware update is consistent with malicious payload or APK injection package.

**Immediate Compromise Indicators:**
- Firebase remote config DNS queries appeared instantly after minimal setup
- Originally only WiFi and Twitter login performed on device and then NextDNS showed immediate suspicious activity including firebase remote configurations, Google remote apis and ton of random apps

**Other wierd things**:
- App not found error briefly for Google Play store 
- Settings has feather suggestions which also gives app not found wrror when first clicked then it brings up smart manager.
- Upon connecting the charger, the bottom edge of the screen lit up with a green glow, accompanied by noticeable visual warping, similar to previous anomalies observed in notifications and overlays.  This is not consistent with the device‚Äôs standard charging behavior and suggests a tampered SystemUI or malicious overlay service designed to spoof system-level visuals.

- Weird WiFi calling notification ‚Äútap ere to confirm or update emergency location information for WiFi calling. This will allow you to make and receive voice calls when cellular network is not available‚Äù  it's a like WiFi calling app? version v14.0.0.0.0005.6 cannot disable it or the notifications.

- Google Docs and GMail app has a ‚Äúswitch to personal drive‚Äô that I can't access

üß† Suspicious or Ambiguous Functionality

com.mediatek.gbaservice
- No activities/providers/receivers: Suggests passive background operation.
- Permission: bind gba service: Could imply inter-process communication with privileged components.
- "Generic bootstrapping architecture": Vague and potentially misleading‚Äîcould be a placeholder for multiple Mediatek subsystems.  
Vector: Privileged IPC / passive service injection

com.tcl.fota.system.overlay
- Overlay-only: No code, permissions, or services‚Äîyet targets firmware update system.
- Persistence risk: Overlay could enforce update UI or suppress user control.  
Vector: Forced update persistence / UI masking

com.android.settings.overlay
- Settings UI modification: Overlaying system settings can mask or redirect user actions.  
Vector: Configuration spoof / user control obfuscation

com.mediatek.op08.ims
- Uses manage users + read precise phone state: Elevated access to user profiles and SIM/network state.
- No clear IMS activity exposed: Could be carrier-specific or hidden VoLTE hooks.  
Vector: SIM control / user profile manipulation

---

üì° Carrier & Network Manipulation

com.android.carrierdefaultapp
- Captive portal login activities: Suggests network onboarding or SIM provisioning.
- Broadcast receivers for slice purchase: Could tie into dynamic carrier billing or eSIM provisioning.
- Permissions: modify phone state, bind job service: Elevated control over network stack.  
Vector: Carrier provisioning / SIM behavior override

com.android.virtualmachine.res
- No code, AOSP tag: Placeholder or stub for virtualization.
- Permissions: debug/manage VM: Hooks into sandboxed environments‚Äîcould be used for app isolation or obfuscation.  
Vector: Virtualization / sandbox manipulation

---

üõ°Ô∏è System Guard / TCL Control Layer

com.tcl.guard
- Large heap + multiple system services: Indicates persistent background operation.
- Constraint proxies: Suggests conditional triggers based on battery/network state.
- Permissions: dump, dynamic receiver, online support AIDL: Potential for remote support or telemetry.
- Ambiguous legitimacy: Could be a security layer or a control mechanism.  
Vector: Telemetry / remote control / conditional execution

---

üì¢ Broadcast & Emergency Messaging

com.mediatek.cellbroadcastuiresoverlay
- Overlay-only: UI masking for cell broadcast‚Äîcheck if it suppresses or redirects alerts.
- No explicit permissions: Could piggyback on com.google.android.cellbroadcastreceiver.  
Vector: Emergency alert spoof / UI suppression

com.google.android.cellbroadcastreceiver
- Runs at boot + airplane mode exit: Persistent alert delivery.
- Permissions: read SMS, read cell broadcasts, post notifications: Expected, but high-impact.
- No battery optimization: Ensures uninterrupted operation.  
Vector: Emergency alert delivery / persistent broadcast

---

üîç General Observations
- Overlay-only packages (fota, settings, cellbroadcastuiresoverlay) are high-risk if they lack code but target critical UI components.
- Carrier and IMS packages often blur the line between legitimate provisioning and covert control.
- TCL-specific apps like guard may be legitimate but warrant byte-level inspection due to their broad permissions and ambiguous roles.
