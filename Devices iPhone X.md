Operating System: iOS 18.4.1
Truststore: ~~~~
Trust Asset Version: 1005

This time i have grown to hate about Apple what i use to think was the best thing about Apple, except i was actually not understanding what actually was happening.

Apple is so locked and to the viewing eye seems to be a simple but it gave me anxist because without Macbook there is no way to see behind the scenes and thats where the gold is.

The iPhone scope is strictly visual.

I did not access any old logins besides the wifi.
### **Notes**

#### Hidden Apps

Hdden UIKits discovered through Screen Time settings:
    - SIM Setup UIKit
    - Screenshots UIKit
    - AuthKit UI Service
    - App Protection UIKit
    - Setup UIKit
    - Connected Devices UI

 UIKits later hidden/removed from Screen Time visibility.
 
 Hidden apps section inaccessible <-- update: as of Sept 2025 -->  can now click hidden apps but the module is clearly overlayed nothing appears when opened but i know something is hidden, my sisters phone doesnt have tbis app folder because she isnt hiding any apps).

In Screentime, in addition to the UI kits, many apps appear in their respectivr apo categories. Its important to note this because originally i had the theory that maybe there were like Webclip (of whatever its called) but, i had never visited reddit.

**These apps include:**
- wikipedia
- reddit
- x

These apps only eppear in screentime. I cannot find them. I have tried searxhing using spotlight and in Settings for them but only thing comes up was the Apple suggestions Safari links. There is a Hidden Apps folder which while now able to click, in both the Apps Drawer (its a empty folder Apps folder), and Apps Settings (bottom section titled Hidden Apps) a "blank' pages shows.

**Talk Back**

I also tried to use Apples accessibility tool Talk Back (?) which is made for blind users and reads the text and elements of page it is on. I purposefully set it to pronounce non Englsh langiage in its native tongue. Also hghlights each speakable part of screen. 

- Noticed highights in middle of sections, sometimes it would try to read either what the prior or following element is.
- Wiikipedia had a really strange pronunciation.

Also, every time i try to use Talk Back, something actively tried to intercept or move direction of what i am doing. Specifically, tney would try to turn on some kind of Accessibility curtian?

Talk Back, some off toggles were actually on and vice versa.

I could not find Notes App i tried searching using spotlight but nthing found. It wasnt until later it appeared.
(Ita giving confusables maybe?)

Files App-has File Storage Folder as the main folder.

Game Center disapparing and reappearing.

 DFU restore is ineffective for removing management flags or MDM profiles. I initially assumed DFU was similar to Android flashing, but it's closer to a factory reset in behavior.
 
DFU restores wipe user data and reinstall the firmware, but they do not remove provisioning or enrollment flags.

(Android flashing is more akin to a clean installâ€”it can overwrite partitions and remove system-level flags, depending on the bootloader state and image used.)

On iPhone, enrollment and provisioning are rooted at the Secure Enclave and activation servers. Once a device is provisioned (e.g., via DEP or MDM), DFU, factory reset, or even firmware reinstallation won't bypass it.

**iOS Network Anomalies**

Three Verizon-branded managed networks present.
Listed as "managed networks" and cannot be deleted or modified
VWZ, VWZ WIFI, VERIZON WIFI

Don't appear in WiFi settings, found in Passwords section.

Discovered one is an APN?

**OS App Store & Settings Anomalies**
Settings app and App Store showing unusual glitch behavior.

App Store access initially blocked completely
Suspicious "Media and Purchases" account situation: Account shown as "disabled" with suspicious reactivation link phising URL masquerading as Apple support and (support.apple.com/?caller=acctenbui)
Settings such as location access being disabled in screentime but upon further detail location access being enabled.

While separate media & purchases accounts are possible legitimately, the implementation appears manipulated which creates an artificial barrier between device access and app store access.
Perpetual Apple ID login loop prevents ability to download apps or using of Apple Account services due to account verification requirements
Phone verification impossible due to SIM swap housing a security trap preventing legitimate account recovery.

Apple family option but unable to join it

**Sim Swap**
Both Sims were e-sims. Different carriers. Many mistakes.

1. After first sim swap, i locked down cellular account, locked my number and created a new number (on the same cellular account). I sim locked sim and enabled the  lock to ensure carrier does not give transfer without the code.

    Accessed WiFi home, usual messaging and browsing. Hours later at work, on another WiFi, got a network notification from App says network may be tampered with. Moments later, Settings disappeared momnentairly. I immedatsly tried to call it and it was off.
    When contacted carrier, they said they wete having "Syatem Issuee" and that sremed to be the cause. 
    They allowed the sim to be swapped.
    They requsted i give them not only the IMEI but other network info which i opted not to.

2. **After i had a DFU done** (before understanding dfu dont wipe provisoning or rootkits)
    Got US Mobile, did Trial. When i went to renew i did it via text. First it asked what i needed to add: text, talk or data. I chose data and it brought up four purchasable options.  250 mb, 1 gb, 500mb, 10gb in that order. Strange so i started over and next texts were in the correct order.
